  m_text: 'I am sleeping in a house in a meadow, or maybe an old cafeteria. It has
    a "school on the prairie" vibe. My contacts are not in. I am awoken by people
    busting down the door, come to kill us (a group of 20 or so men and women in
    their 20s - 40s and 50s). The new group is men, women, and children ages 3 through
    60, mostly adults. They have huge guns. We all run down some stairs, a half level
    down to the dining room floor. We had been asleep in the hallway overlooking
    it. Crouching and listening, I see that all of them except two men went outside
    on the side-porch to eat lunch, assuming we had left. A man on my side whispers
    that the bald one on the right is "the head psycho", so we dip out through the
    back side-door emergency exit. As we''re sneaking around, I realize I don''t
    have my contacts in and probably will never be able to retrieve them. I tell
    someone I can''t really see and they scold me for not keeping spares in my bulletproof
    vest pocket. We run around to the side of the house where people are eating lunch.
    Most stay back behind the building while a few higher-ups come around with me.
    I find a tiny gun not much bigger than a lighter, stand straight up from the
    white concrete barrier we were crouched behind, walk behind a pillar onto the
    grass next to the porch (a concrete floor in line with the earth), and silently
    go in line shooting them: a man in his 50s with a shaved head, a young girl (who
    I thought about not but then decided better dead than an orphan), another young
    girl, and a woman in her 40s - their mother maybe - and then a Steve Bannon-looking
    man. All except him looked straight out of the FLDS, with long braids and pastel
    cotton long dresses and sleeves despite the boiling heat. I said numbers while
    I shot them at point blank range: 400, 200 300 500 300. The gun made only tiny
    zipping noises, as if darts were landing but they were bullets. The people made
    no noise. I short the greasy older man (Steve Bannon), disheveled while the others
    are prim and proper, wearing dirty checkered shirt and leather suspenders. I
    shoot him in the back because he is sitting at the corner across the table from
    the woman (the rest were against the wall). He doesn''t flinch, just turns around
    as if to say "what do you want?" I shoot him six or seven times in the back but
    with little impact. I can see the holes aren''t as deep as before, that the gun
    is running out of juice, not bullets. I circle around to the other side of him,
    and he''s talking to me like "you can''t kill me, no way." The gun clicks, but
    nothing comes out. I had shot him 12+ times but some only as deep as papercuts
    to his back and chest. People on the front side of the house see me, and chaos
    is bubbling up. I toss the tiny gun and run towards the back of the house. Three
    women dressed in all black, with long leather coats and gloves, are standing
    on the grass near the concrete block. I run towards them and yell "give me your
    gun!" to the one on the right with curly red hair (who looks like Catherine from
    Twin Peaks) because she has a tiny gun. She tries to kick me and yells "we''re
    not on your side", and I keep running towards the back of the house. Two men
    are now stationed around back, laying on the ground with electric cannons on
    massive tripods pointed at the backdoor. I stop once I notice them. Walking back
    towards the front of the house, I see a tall man with a massive gun, again in
    all black with leather gloves, standing near the back corner (on the grass about
    5 feet from the porch). I sprint up to him and jump and grab his gun while running
    past. Chaos officially breaks loose. I cannot find anyone else on my side. I
    run towards the front of the house with the huge gun, assuming it''s a machine
    gun. I fire at the scattered people on the porch and a fireball emerges and explodes
    when it hits the ground. The people on the front porch are mostly young teens
    - not who I''m looking for. I shoot another fireball at some adult men further
    down but decide the gun is more attention than it''s worth. I start running away
    from the house and realize I''m running with a woman from my side. We run into
    the forest surrounding the house. //

    It''s afternoon of that day, and we''ve
    been running in the heat with no supplies. We are followed by a woman from the
    other side carrying her toddler. She is not in a dress like the others were.
    She is surprisingly fast, keeping pace with us, but we''re trying to conserve
    energy. We approach a power station, out of the woods and down a hill. There
    are very high fences surrounding the area, maybe it is an elementary school.
    I run up to a gate - locked. I run farther down - unlocked. I open it and my
    comrade runs through behind me. I yell "lock it" and she yells "why bother" but
    does. The slowdown allows the woman to catch up to us. While she''s coming through
    the gate, we decide to poison her with the fruits of the trees in this fenced
    area. My comrade is vaguely sure that the kiwi-looking fruit of the small withering
    tree in the southwest corner of the yard is poisonous. As the woman comes in
    the yard, I say "I''m mighty hungry, aren''t you?", and pick an apple/green tomato
    hybrid fruit from another tree. Then I walk away while my comrade approaches
    her and they talk civilly as she corrals her towards the poison tree. I am searching
    for another exit. I want to climb the chainlink fence,  but it is 20 feet high
    and I believe the top railing to be electrified. There is a playground in the
    opposite corner of the lot, next to a hulking brick building looming over everything.
    Power lines go into the distance, into the woods, the rolling hills. I find another
    unlocked gate, going east. I look over my shoulder; the woman has taken a bite
    of the kiwi, and my comrade is motioning for me to start running, and I do. I
    run down the steep pebbly slope away from the lot, my comrade 100 feet behind
    me, and the woman 10 feet behind her. My comrade passes the gate and I am almost
    in the woods when I run into a man. I don''t think he is on a side. He is dressed
    normally: t-shirt, baseball cap, and running shoes. He is walking his golden
    retriever and is fairly old, in his late 60s. I look over my shoulder back up
    the hill and the woman has just gotten past the gate when she shakes violently
    and falls to her knees. She is dying quickly. My comrade keeping running towards
    me, almost 20 feet away. I tell the man to take care of the child and run into
    the woods.

    I am in a library/bunker writing a letter on tiny scraps of dark
    brown paper. I get up from my beg, which has a built-in desk at the end (Oberlin
    dorm desk with the high back and shelf), and go past another row of beds into
    a side room lit with yellow light. It is a reference room, a little bigger than
    a pantry, with bookshelves starting at hip-height on top of a countertop. I look
    for one and find it, a law book about citizen''s rights in our country. I live
    somewhere in Europe in times past, WWII but not really. I take the thick green
    book back to my bed-desk. Alex is sitting with his legs over the side of a wooden
    chair almost opposite the reference room door. He is yelling to someone else
    in the bunker, so he doesn''t notice me. I sit down at the edge of my bed again
    and open up the book, leafing through slightly. When I collect the scraps of
    brown paper and read through them, I''m dissatisfied. They are cryptic and meandering,
    addressed to "Wanda". I put them aside. Cut to me writing on a full-size sheet
    of lined paper, in orange ink, starting with "Dear Fuhrer". I am explaining my
    situation, that I have a husband stuck living like a peasant in Siberia and that
    the living conditions are not feasible anymore. Alex now notices the book and
    asks where I got it. He sounds angry. I explain there is a reference room right
    behind him and I didn''t go into the main library to get it. "Oh good," he says,
    "I thought you were out stealing from the central collection." Cur to another
    iteration of the same letter, in which I have gained audience with two Siberian
    princesses. I am no longer in the library-bunker, for they have taken me to Siberia
    to prove how hard the peasant work is. A new draft of the letter is read aloud
    and translucently projected over the scene. I am on my hands and knees in a small
    hut, dressed as best I can for winter in peasant''s rags. I pick up off the floor
    a massive stone, with difficulty since it is half the size of me. I stagger out
    of the hut into the vicious winter''s early twilight, using my back to push open
    the door to a main shack/house. There the two princesses stand in white nightgowns,
    almost 7 feet tall and with long black hair and deeply tanned skin. They are
    almost identical. They look Egyptian. It is hot in the shack. I manage the few
    steps from the door to a cot, walking backwards until I can deposit the rock
    in the cot by my right leg. In exhaustion, I flop into the bed over it. Before
    I can move, the princesses quickly throw a thin mattress over me and lay on it
    together, all their weight pressing down on top of me. (The letter is no longer
    projected or being read.) I struggle slightly, but I am weak and soon suffocate.
    One princess moves to rise, but the other says, "Let''s stay until she stops
    twitching." When I stop moving, they get up. After the lights are then turned
    out for the night, as they lay in their own cots, a golden glow projects out
    of one of their bodies. Out of it forms the image of a sleeping female pharaoh
    in full regal attire, with a deep purple headdress striped with aqua and pink
    embroidered lines, and dark swirls of kohl under her eyes. The image freezes
    and the credits roll: "Phoecii" in big golden letters at the top of the screen,
    the same font as "Aguirre: Wrath of God".

    I was high and walking through
    the main hallway of Newark Academy. It was incredibly packed with people, but
    it was dark outside. We were all going to classes. When I reached where the L-intersection
    should have been, I entered a room similar to the Eberstadt room except all the
    armchairs were on raised tiers. The layout, with all the raised tiers curving
    around the individual or rows of armchairs, reminded me of a rice patty. The
    hallway I was in entered to the back-right corner of the room, right into a row
    of chairs. There were many obnoxious schoolboys in there chairs, but Pieter-Paul
    was in the one second closest to me. The front of the room had two hallways extending
    from it. In the middle of the room were many wooden tables. The space between
    the two front hallways was a massive mirror with a gold ornate frame. All the
    tables had flowers in vases on them. The lone armchair on the right side of the
    room was occupied by Mr. Stourton, who tried to stop me to talk about the theme
    of candles in Yeats. When anyone tried to speak to me, all that came out was
    "are you fine?" "Yes" echoed and buzzed in a constant murmur around the room.
    I pushed through the front-right hallway''s door into the corridor leading away
    from the arts wing. It was that hallway but with much more glass and shine to
    it. Once I was through the other room''s door, it disappeared and the hallway
    continued that way a while longer before reaching an open gallery space. There
    was a yellow twisty sculpture, like Chicago Millenium Park''s, in the middle
    of the room. On the walls were unimportant paintings.

    The five of us escaped
    through the window of a gray, brick building. It was so tall you couldn''t see
    the top, but we weren''t too high up (less than 10 floors). We single-file shuffled
    along a concrete window ledge, sometimes ducking below windows of classrooms
    of bored students. I was second to last and careless, so someone almost saw me.
    The entire back of the building faced an incredibly large cave entrance. The
    dome of the cave was stopped halfway by the building, which continued upwards
    beyond the cave. The first member of our group was already onto the building
    below ours, standing on a tiny patch of roof by a crumbling chimney. That building
    was more of a shack with old-fashioned tiling on the roof. Everything was still
    grey. She had a long thick wire attached to a hardness at her end and a metal
    bracket at ours. We all swung over there, precariously catapulting onto the slippery
    roof. We started climbing down the chimney, which had ladder rungs carved into
    it. We reached the ground, a rocky beach with no sand. The water lapped up gently
    by us, but soon turned into a raging waterfall that disappeared over a 90 degree
    cliff. The stony cave walls acted as a funnel to the waterfall. Out of nowhere,
    we had a tiny dark green raft, all blown up and ready to go. Once we loaded in
    all five of us, we realized it wasn''t close to being blown up enough. I noticed
    the bottom section wasn''t blown up at all, and told the others. They freaked
    out, as we neared the waterfall. We paddled like crazy to gain about 10 feet
    away from the fall. I started blowing up the raft like crazy. It was barely blown
    up when we slipped into the current once again.'

  m_text: "In a shack-type townhouse, dingy and rundown, I am taking care of an infant
    and freaking out. This is at Oberlin College, where I am taking a math class
    with Mr. Alford (the NA comp sci teacher). It is 9:38, and I am trying so hard
    to rush out the door to catch that last 10 minutes of class, but my mom is there
    and she doesn't want to watch the kid. She says \"that's your kid - it's your
    responsibility.\" I look up, and it is 9:50. I have 10 minutes before he leaves
    the math building to get there and at least give him a note I wrote explaining
    my situation. I have missed 5 weeks of classes consecutively, and if I miss any
    more, I will fail his course. My mom is reluctantly going to take care of the
    child - this happens everyday. By the time I get out the door, it is 10:01 and
    I realize I have no idea where the math building is. I didn't know there was
    a math building at Oberlin, but the campus is large and confusing like Purdue
    (where there is a math building). I ask some people around and they tell me that
    the math building is way up campus (I am down campus) but that math classes are
    taught at the dept's \"downtown location\". It is nighttime and warm out: summer.
    I am running and running, but when I get to the math building - not the downtown
    location - it is huge, concrete, and completely dark. I have been shut down.
    I have failed. I crumple up the note where I explain what happened and throw
    it on the ground. It tells this story: I am walking around in July, the July
    before. I am eating food with a friend in an outdoor restaurant far below a huge
    system of boardwalks with lots of people around. It is dimly lit, nighttime again,
    only lit by small candles on each table and rainbow Christmas lights strung all
    around the restaurant. It is a Creole food place. I am moderately pregnant, and
    we are talking about how I will balance school and the child, concluding I won't
    really even though my mom is moving here to help. My friend says it's a shame
    I didn't get an abortion, and I get up in arms and start realizing I don't remember
    when I got pregnant. I am walking along the same boardwalk system with my mom,
    who has flown in, and she says I am not allowed to have an abortion because we
    have the financial means to care for a child. I don't say anything. I start wondering
    how I got pregnant - why don't I remember? Why is it confusing? At first, I reason
    that some women get pregnant with IUDs in anyway, but then I argue to my mom
    that the baby will be deformed and not viable anyway because of the IUD! I get
    an ultrasound, but there is no IUD - I do not know where it could have gone.
    // \nIt is a dark chapel, like the round part of Fairchild formed into a full
    circle, and the whole floor except for a small lip of stone you can walk around
    on is an incredibly deep pool, hundreds of feet deep I assume - it faded into
    blackness quickly. It was dark dark blue water with little green plants growing
    in the rocks on the edges. It is daytime and cloudy, and light comes in weakly
    from high windows. Some wizards are there in stereotypical dress: huge, dark
    red robes lined with white fur and littered with gold embroidered stars and matching
    pointy hats. They are the same shape as the chapel, little cylindrical men with
    long long pure white beards. They are not identical to each other but incredibly
    similar. Only one stands by the doorway I came through. The others are talking
    amongst themselves silently on the opposite side of the room from him, where
    there is a larger lip between the pool and the wall and wooden doors leading
    elsewhere. He tells me to dive in and find the pearl that glows brightest to
    me. I dive in strong and hard and go deep very quickly. Hundreds of pearls are
    loosely wrapped in gold wire and attached to long, golden strings that seem to
    extend to the surface,  though there was no sign of this from above. I am swimming
    and swimming in near darkness, the blue so incomprehensibly deep and beautiful,
    almost black in richness but not colour. You seem to never run into walls down
    here; the water extends forever. All the pearls glow slightly, but suddenly I
    see one beaming from far away. I reach it and grab on to it: it is so imperfect,
    it is almost bean-shaped instead of the perfect circles of all the others. I
    grab hold anyway without hesitation - I trust the wizards - and rocket towards
    the surface as fast as I can. My clothes are heavy, but I feel myself going up
    up up up until I break the surface right at the wizard's feet. He takes the pearl,
    somehow no longer attached to any string, and observes it quietly. The other
    wizards are staring, and some begin to leave solemnly. He sighs. I get out of
    the pool. He puts the pearl in one of his pockets, puts his hands on my shoulders,
    and says \"I am sorry to say yes\" before leaving me alone in the chapel. When
    he touched my shoulders, I was given the knowledge that I was pregnant with a
    deformed child. // The same chapel but with no pool there, just huge stones for
    flooring. A group of young men in their early 20s are talking, all except one
    sitting on a step that goes across the middle of the room. His back is turned
    to your viewpoint, and you never see his face. He has broad shoulders and dark
    brown hair cut short. He is wearing a light blue jumpsuit, folded over to be
    only pants, and a matching shirt. The jumpsuit has tons of pockets. He is taking
    thing after thing out of his pockets, and the other men are laughing and having
    a good time. The last thing he pulls out are huge and wide strips of velcro,
    padded on one side only. For some reason, this is very ominous to the other men,
    who fall silent. One asks \"why do you have those?\", and the standing man replies
    that they are very useful. It is now clear that this is the father of my deformed
    child.\nI dreamt that I figured out how to delete the physical occupation of
    space. Not disappear but be invisible. So I deleted my car, early morning, and
    deleted everything in it so the whole thing was invisible. Parked and went inside
    of a deli to get breakfast. Came back outside and couldn't figure out how to
    get the non-invisible breakfast (croissant with a fried egg in it) back into
    the invisible car - only stuff already in the car when it turned invisible could
    access it. When I tried tossing it through the sunroof, it landed on the pavement.
    I got in holding the breakfast and turned invisible too, so you could only see
    my clothes and make-up floating down the highway. I thought being invisible meant
    I could not get stuck in traffic, but I was wrong - took up the same amount of
    space but no one could tell until they bumped into my car.\nI dreamt that I was
    in a bookstore with Laura. We sat on plush orange and green benches (ottomans?),
    pouring over the book The Line Becomes A River, explaining to a stranger sitting
    on an ottoman to my left why we hated the book. The woman leaned in as I showed
    her a page, saying \"Look how many citations, how self-important! Every sentence
    on this page has a footnote!\" The book pages were not normal - the sentences
    were single lines arranged sloppily in white rectangles along the centerline
    of the page against a black and gray starry background, drawn childishly, sloppily.
    The \"citations\" were large white asterisks drawn crudely next to each white
    strip. The font was like an old typewriter, uneven and blurry. Not sure what
    it said. While still holding the page open to the woman as she looks over it
    in silent agreement, I loop up and notice an old woman leaving the bookstore
    by the exit farthest from me. I get up and follow, leaving the book. When I have
    caught up to her on the subway platform outside, she tells me, \"I have had two
    sadnesses in my life.\" Her face is perpetually hidden under a large rice farmers
    hat, her back stooped so she is much shorter than me, dressed in ragged clothes
    and sandals. She describes a shadow that follows her, lurking in the corner of
    her eye wherever she turns. I see through her eyes walking through an old posh
    house, a loose blackness the size of a large crow flitting in and out of my vision.
    It was too quick to ever see it, but it was always just over your shoulder, always
    hovering next to your cheek just beyond where you could see or feel it. As I
    saw her memories, she poured out thick white paint onto the rough beige-gray
    concrete like an Anselm Keifer painting. The paint splattered and spread like
    clammy fingers across the floor, getting poured into the shape of the top of
    an umbrella, similar to her hat. Suddenly she sunk into herself, face caving
    in while still shadowy under her hat - she had consumed herself, all her flesh
    disappearing into her gaping mouth, somehow blacker than the black surrounding
    darkness. She was gone.\nI dreamt that I was sitting on the curb of a highway,
    in the middle, a grass median, near an overpass. Sat with cars going right to
    left. Will sat to my left. I put my hand on his knee to help myself up, very
    stiffly. He snapped, \"Don't fucking touch me.\" Later in my apartment (but not
    my actual apartment), Evan showed up at my door in a half full-body cast. Right
    leg to full torso to left arm. Blood on his face. Crutches. Asked if he could
    come in, so I said sure. Then I told him about the weird interaction with Will.
    He responded with something wise, but I don't remember what.\nJarrett and I were
    at a family reunion of his, all staying in one sprawling house, a labyrinthine
    version of my childhood home. I grabbed him and dragged him into a bedroom. I
    was trying to be sneaky, but it wasn't our room and I left my bra in there. For
    some reason, Donna from Parks and Rec was at the reunion and later came up to
    me, bra dangling from her fingers. \"Is this yours? Because I know it's not mine...
    Stop going in my room.\" I was very embarrassed.\nI was a little blond girl,
    walking through the woods with my mother, father, and twin. We were about 8,
    dressed identically in goofy light blue dresses. A tiger, massive and white,
    materialized out of a fallen tree. It appeared to be wearing a purple jersey
    with a yellow #1, but it was dyed/part of its fur. It began chasing us. We escaped
    after a short encounter. It bounded away without further incident. We kept hiking.
    In the afternoon, it reappeared, emerging from a similar fallen tree. This time
    it went straight for my father, who was walking first. My mother was last, and
    I was second. He lead it away up the mountain, not on the path. He shouted at
    us to go home. The tiger could materialize anywhere anytime, so we had to be
    painfully quiet and slow. We realized that the tiger couldn't sense us if we
    squat-walked under the curve of a large piece of tree bark, us three all under
    one sheet. We returned to a cobbled street. I ran to a nearby seaside market.
    I wandered through the stalls right up close to the wall overlooking the sea
    cliff. I bumped into James, who was wearing a black t-shirt and khaki military
    pants tucked into black boots. We talked like good friends, and he comforted
    and hugged me when I told him my family had been haunted by the tiger. By now,
    I was myself again, no longer a little blond girl. We walked hadn't in hand to
    the ocean, going down a carved cliffside staircase in a corner of the spice market.\nI
    was biking with Erin on tricycles in New York City, and we rode down this steep
    hill and turned left into a parking lot. There was an elevated highway acting
    as a roof, and everything was very grey. This fat old man came up to us and started
    talking. No one else was around. Still on my tricycle, I dropped something and
    went to pick it up, but the fat old man got there first. I got angry because
    he was a stranger touching my stuff, and he was giving off this 'creep' vibe.
    I tried to make him let go of it, and when he finally did, he said, \"Ladies
    do not pick things off the ground.\" Suddenly, I was no longer on a tricycle,
    but I stood up and we were teleported to my bedroom/if everything past and including
    the bed were blocked by a wall. I started yelling at him, and he put his hand
    on my shoulder. Then I went completely ape shit on him, and we flickered between
    the parking lot and my room (version of it). Erin walked out of the door of my
    room without saying anything just as Claire from Lilov walked into the parking
    lot. I was punching and kicking this oldie while Claire pulled a stick out of
    nowhere and started hitting him too. He fell back against my bed, and Claire
    closed the door. I yelled at him while Claire brandished her stick (it was like
    a baseball bat only not polished out). He started blubbering and asked why we
    were doing this, and I shouted, \"So you can feel the humiliation you put every
    woman through.\" He started blubbering again, and I got bored/irritated, so we
    kicked him out."
